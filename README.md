# gallifreyanGenerator
A tool to generate Sherman's gallifreyan

Currently supports multiple words, but just prints them next to each other on a line. 
There are a few bugs regarding where to place decorations and I have not yet made any attempts to arrange objects in a reasonable way.

Usage:
`python gallifreyan.py -n word1 word2 ...`
or
`python gallifreyan.py` 
for a default phrase.
